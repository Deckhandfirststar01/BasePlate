# BasePlate

BasePlate is a bare theme for WordPress that includes an up-to-date assets manager via laravel-mix/WebPack. BasePlate lends a lot of code from Sage and WordPlate. By combining these two templates an easy to use and easy to maintain template was created. It ditches the full WP installation from WordPlate while maintaining the buildtools and uses core code from sage while ditching the blade template modules.

## Installation

To use BasePlate, you need to have PHP 7.0+ installed on your machine. You'll also optionally need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed if you want to use [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix) to compile your CSS and Javascript and maintain your images.

Make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 7.0
- Mbstring PHP Extension


After copying the contents in a new theme folder, don't forget to set the proxy adress for BrowserSync in the webpack.mix.js file.

To install required node modules:

```bash
npm install
```
## Use Webpack & MIX

BasePlate has integrated [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix) out of the box. It provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Webpack build steps for your BasePlate template.

#### How do I use it?

Run BrowserSync and check for changes and auto-compile on the go:
```bash
npm run watch
```
During development:
```bash
npm run development
```

Enable cache busting and minifying for production use:
```bash
npm run production
```

## Plugins

[WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org) comes straight out of the box with WordPlate. It mirrors the WordPress [plugin](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org) and [theme](https://themes.svn.wordpress.org) directories as a Composer repository.

#### How do I use it?

Require the desired plugin or theme using `wpackagist-plugin` or `wpackagist-theme` as the vendor name.

```bash
composer require wpackagist-plugin/polylang
```

Packages are installed to `public/plugins` or `public/themes`.

#### Example

This is an example of how your `composer.json` file might look like.

```json
"require": {
    "wordplate/framework": "^5.0",
    "wpackagist-plugin/polylang": "^2.1",
},
```

## Post Types

For [custom post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types) we recommend looking at [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts) by [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion). The package provides extended functionality to WordPress custom post types, allowing developers to quickly build post types without having to write the same code again and again.

```php
register_extended_post_type('event');
```

## Custom Fields

For [custom fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields) we recommend looking at the following plugins:
